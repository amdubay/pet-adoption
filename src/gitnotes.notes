Please be advised, while experimenting with some packages, my project 'broke'.

After much debugging, and trying to remove packages with errors, I opted to backup project files, and recreate the project from scratch.

While this was successful in fixing the issue, the project disconnected from the Github, and a decent amount of updates have been made to the project (mostly css/design elements)

Although I would have liked to have more commits since the last 'real' commit, I do not. This file is solely a placeholder to explain gaps in commit history.
